# 🧠 Steven Kearney - Project Index

My personal portfolio -- a curated index of the projects, stacks, and systems I’ve built or documented.

Updated periodically to reflect new projects and improvements.

> These aren’t meant to be tutorials, they're records of what I built, what worked, and what I learned.
>"Build, Break, Fix, Learn, Repeat"
